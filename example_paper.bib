abstract = {Time series classification has been around for decades in the data-mining and machine learning communities. In this paper, we investigate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for time series classification. Such networks have been widely used in many domains like computer vision and speech recognition, but only a little for time series classification. We design a convolu-tional neural network that consists of two convolutional layers. One drawback with CNN is that they need a lot of training data to be efficient. We propose two ways to circumvent this problem: designing data-augmentation techniques and learning the network in a semi-supervised way using training time series from different datasets. These techniques are experimentally evaluated on a benchmark of time series datasets.},

abstract = {Time series classification (TSC), the problem of predicting class labels of time series, has been around for decades within the community of data mining and machine learning, and found many important applications such as biomedical engineering and clinical prediction. However, it still remains challenging and falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into account the fact that time series often have features at different time scales. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model, Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN), which incorporates feature extraction and classification in a single framework. Leveraging a novel multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically extracts features at different scales and frequencies, leading to superior feature representation. MCNN is also computationally efficient, as it naturally leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with various existing methods on a large number of benchmark datasets, and show that MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance than other leading methods.},

abstract = {Background--Structural remodeling of human atria plays a key role in sustaining atrial fibrillation (AF), but insufficient quantitative analysis of human atrial structure impedes the treatment of AF. We aimed to develop a novel 3-dimensional (3D) structural and computational simulation analysis tool that could reveal the structural contributors to human reentrant AF drivers. Methods and Results--High-resolution panoramic epicardial optical mapping of the coronary-perfused explanted intact human atria (63-year-old woman, chronic hypertension, heart weight 608 g) was conducted during sinus rhythm and sustained AF maintained by spatially stable reentrant AF drivers in the left and right atrium. The whole atria (107961985 mm3) were then imaged with contrast-enhancement MRI (9.4 T, 180×180×360-$\mu$m3 resolution). The entire 3D human atria were analyzed for wall thickness (0.4-11.7 mm), myofiber orientations, and transmural fibrosis (36.9{\%} subendocardium; 14.2{\%} midwall; 3.4{\%} subepicardium). The 3D computational analysis revealed that a specific combination of wall thickness and fibrosis ranges were primarily present in the optically defined AF driver regions versus nondriver tissue. Finally, a 3D human heart-specific atrial computer model was developed by integrating 3D structural and functional mapping data to test AF induction, maintenance, and ablation strategies. This 3D model reproduced the optically defined reentrant AF drivers, which were uninducible when fibrosis and myofiber anisotropy were removed from the model. Conclusions--Our novel 3D computational high-resolution framework may be used to quantitatively analyze structural substrates, such as wall thickness, myofiber orientation, and fibrosis, underlying localized AF drivers, and aid the development of new patientspecific treatments.},

abstract = {Background - Phase analysis of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, has gained interest because of the ability to detect organized stable drivers (rotors) and target them for therapy. However, the lack of methodology details in publications on the topic has resulted in ongoing debate over the phase mapping technique. By comparing phase maps and activation maps, we examined advantages and limitations of phase mapping. Methods and Results - Seven subjects were enrolled. We generated phase maps and activation maps from electrocardiographic imaging-reconstructed epicardial unipolar electrograms. For ventricular signals, phase was computed with (1) pseudoempirical mode decomposition detrending and (2) a novel Moving Average (MVG) detrending approach. For atrial fibrillation signals, MVG was modified to incorporate dynamic cycle length (DCL) changes (MVG-DCL). Phase maps were visually analyzed to study phase singularity points and rotors. Results show that phase is sensitive to cycle length choice, a limitation that was addressed by the MVG-DCL algorithm. MVG-DCL was optimal for atrial fibrillation analysis. Phase maps helped to highlight high-curvature wavefronts and rotors. However, for some activation patterns, phase generated nonrotational singularity points and false rotors. Conclusions - Phase mapping computes singularity points and visually highlights rotors. As such, it can help to provide a clearer picture of the spatiotemporal activation characteristics during atrial fibrillation. However, it is advisable to incorporate electrogram characteristics and the time-domain activation sequence in the analysis, to prevent misinterpretation and false rotor detection. Therefore, for mapping complex arrhythmias, a combined time-domain activation and phase mapping with variable cycle length seems to be the most reliable method.},

abstract = {Background - New approaches to ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) include focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM) mapping, and initial results reported with this technique have been favorable. We sought to independently evaluate the approach by analyzing quantitative characteristics of atrial electrograms used to identify rotors and describe acute procedural outcomes of FIRM-guided ablation. Methods and Results - All FIRM-guided ablation procedures (n=24; 50{\%} paroxysmal) at University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center were included for analysis. During AF, unipolar atrial electrograms collected from a 64-pole basket catheter were used to construct phase maps and identify putative AF sources. These sites were targeted for ablation, in conjunction with pulmonary vein isolation in most patients (n=19; 79{\%}). All patients had rotors identified (mean, 2.3±0.9 per patient; 72{\%} in left atrium). Prespecified acute procedural end point was achieved in 12 of 24 (50{\%}) patients: AF termination (n=1), organization (n=3), or {\textgreater}10{\%} slowing of AF cycle length (n=8). Basket electrodes were within 1 cm of 54{\%} of left atrial surface area, and a mean of 31 electrodes per patient showed interpretable atrial electrograms. Offline analysis revealed no differences between rotor and distant sites in dominant frequency or Shannon entropy. Electroanatomic mapping showed no rotational activation at FIRM-identified rotor sites in 23 of 24 patients (96{\%}). Conclusions - FIRM-identified rotor sites did not exhibit quantitative atrial electrogram characteristics expected from rotors and did not differ quantitatively from surrounding tissue. Catheter ablation at these sites, in conjunction with pulmonary vein isolation, resulted in AF termination or organization in a minority of patients (4/24; 17{\%}). Further validation of this approach is necessary.},

abstract = {Mapping resolution has recently been identified as a key limitation in successfully locating the drivers of atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a simple cellular automata model of AF, we demonstrate a method by which re-entrant drivers can be located quickly and accurately using a collection of indirect electrogram measurements. The method proposed employs simple, out-of-the-box machine learning algorithms to correlate characteristic electrogram gradients with the displacement of an electrogram recording from a re-entrant driver. Such a method is less sensitive to local fluctuations in electrical activity. As a result, the method successfully locates 95.4{\%} of drivers in tissues containing a single driver, and 95.1{\%} (92.6{\%}) for the first (second) driver in tissues containing two drivers of AF. Additionally, we demonstrate how the technique can be applied to tissues with an arbitrary number of drivers. In its current form, the techniques presented are not refined enough for a clinical setting. However, the methods proposed offer a promising path for future investigations aimed at improving targeted ablation for AF.},

abstract = {Background - The presence of focal fibrillation waves during atrial fibrillation (AF) can, besides ectopic activity, also be explained by asynchronous activation of the atrial endo- and epicardial layer and transmurally propagating fibrillation waves. To provide direct proof of endo-epicardial asynchrony, we performed simultaneous high-resolution mapping of the right atrial endo- and epicardial wall during AF in humans. Method and Results - Intraoperative mapping of the endo- and epicardial right atrial wall was performed during (induced) AF in 10 patients with AF (paroxysmal: n=3; persistent: n=4; and longstanding persistent: n=3) and 4 patients without a history of AF. A clamp made of 2 rectangular 8×16 electrode arrays (interelectrode distance 2 mm) was inserted into the incision in the right atrial appendage. Recordings of 10 seconds of AF were analyzed to determine the incidence of asynchronous endo-epicardial activation times (≥15 ms) of opposite electrodes. Asynchronous endo-epicardial activation ranged between 0.9 and 55.9{\%} without preference for either side. Focal waves appeared equally frequent at endocardium and epicardium (11{\%} versus 13{\%}; P=0.18). Using strict criteria for breakthrough (presence of an opposite wave within 4 mm and ≤14 ms before the origin of the focal wave), the majority (65{\%}) of all focal fibrillation waves could be attributed to endo-epicardial excitation. Conclusions - We provided the first evidence for asynchronous activation of the endo-epicardial wall during AF in humans. Endo-epicardial asynchrony may play a major role in the pathophysiology of AF and may offer an explanation why in some patients therapy fails.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study sought to improve atrial fibrillation (AF) driver identification by integrating clinical multielectrode mapping with driver fingerprints defined by high-resolution ex vivo 3-dimensional (3D) functional and structural imaging. Background: Clinical multielectrode mapping of AF drivers suffers from variable contact, signal processing, and structural complexity within the 3D human atrial wall, raising questions on the validity of such drivers. Methods: Sustained AF was mapped in coronary-perfused explanted human hearts (n = 11) with transmural near-infrared optical mapping (∼0.3 mm 2 resolution). Simultaneously, custom FIRMap catheters (∼9 × 9 mm 2 resolution) mapped endocardial and epicardial surfaces, which were analyzed by Focal Impulse and Rotor Mapping activation and Rotational Activity Profile (Abbott Labs, Chicago, Illinois). Functional maps were integrated with contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (∼0.1 mm 3 resolution) analysis of 3D fibrosis architecture. Results: During sustained AF, near-infrared optical mapping identified 1 to 2 intramural, spatially stable re-entrant AF drivers per heart. Driver targeted ablation affecting 2.2 ± 1.1{\%} of the atrial surface terminated and prevented AF. Driver regions had significantly higher phase singularity density and dominant frequency than neighboring nondriver regions. Focal Impulse and Rotor Mapping had 80{\%} sensitivity to near-infrared optical mapping–defined driver locations (16 of 20), and matched 14 of 20 driver visualizations: 10 of 14 re-entries seen with Rotational Activity Profile; and 4 of 6 breakthrough/focal patterns. Focal Impulse and Rotor Mapping detected 1.1 ± 0.9 false-positive rotational activity profiles per recording, but these regions had lower intramural contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging fibrosis than did driver regions (14.9 ± 7.9{\%} vs. 23.2 ± 10.5{\%}; p {\textless} 0.005). Conclusions: The study revealed that both re-entrant and breakthrough/focal AF driver patterns visualized by surface-only clinical multielectrodes can represent projections of 3D intramural microanatomic re-entries. Integration of multielectrode mapping and 3D fibrosis analysis may enhance AF driver detection, thereby improving the efficacy of driver-targeted ablation.},

abstract = {Background-Specific noninvasive signal processing was applied to identify drivers in distinct categories of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and Results-In 103 consecutive patients with persistent AF, accurate biatrial geometry relative to an array of 252 body surface electrodes was obtained from a noncontrast computed tomography scan. The reconstructed unipolar AF electrograms acquired at bedside from multiple windows (duration, 9±1 s) were signal processed to identify the drivers (focal or reentrant activity) and their cumulative density map. The driver domains were catheter ablated by using AF termination as the procedural end point in comparison with the stepwise-ablation control group. The maps showed incessantly changing beat-to-beat wave fronts and varying spatiotemporal behavior of driver activities. Reentries were not sustained (median, 2.6 rotations lasting 449±89 ms), meandered substantially but recurred repetitively in the same region. In total, 4720 drivers were identified in 103 patients: 3802 (80.5{\%}) reentries and 918 (19.5{\%}) focal breakthroughs; most of them colocalized. Of these, 69{\%} reentries and 71{\%} foci were in the left atrium. Driver ablation alone terminated 75{\%} and 15{\%} of persistent and long-lasting AF, respectively. The number of targeted driver regions increased with the duration of continuous AF: 2 in patients presenting in sinus rhythm, 3 in AF lasting 1 to 3 months, 4 in AF lasting 4 to 6 months, and 6 in AF lasting longer. The termination rate sharply declined after 6 months. The mean radiofrequency delivery to AF termination was 28±17 minutes versus 65±33 minutes in the control group (P{\textless}0.0001). At 12 months, 85{\%} patients with AF termination were free from AF, similar to the control population (87{\%},); P=not significant.

abstract = {Objectives: We hypothesized that human atrial fibrillation (AF) may be sustained by localized sources (electrical rotors and focal impulses), whose elimination (focal impulse and rotor modulation [FIRM]) may improve outcome from AF ablation. Background: Catheter ablation for AF is a promising therapy, whose success is limited in part by uncertainty in the mechanisms that sustain AF. We developed a computational approach to map whether AF is sustained by several meandering waves (the prevailing hypothesis) or localized sources, then prospectively tested whether targeting patient-specific mechanisms revealed by mapping would improve AF ablation outcome. Methods: We recruited 92 subjects during 107 consecutive ablation procedures for paroxysmal or persistent (72{\%}) AF. Cases were prospectively treated, in a 2-arm 1:2 design, by ablation at sources (FIRM-guided) followed by conventional ablation (n = 36), or conventional ablation alone (n = 71; FIRM-blinded). Results: Localized rotors or focal impulses were detected in 98 (97{\%}) of 101 cases with sustained AF, each exhibiting 2.1 ± 1.0 sources. The acute endpoint (AF termination or consistent slowing) was achieved in 86{\%} of FIRM-guided cases versus 20{\%} of FIRM-blinded cases (p {\textless} 0.001). FIRM ablation alone at the primary source terminated AF in a median 2.5 min (interquartile range: 1.0 to 3.1 min). Total ablation time did not differ between groups (57.8 ± 22.8 min vs. 52.1 ± 17.8 min, p = 0.16). During a median 273 days (interquartile range: 132 to 681 days) after a single procedure, FIRM-guided cases had higher freedom from AF (82.4{\%} vs. 44.9{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001) after a single procedure than FIRM-blinded cases with rigorous, often implanted, electrocardiography monitoring. Adverse events did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Localized electrical rotors and focal impulse sources are prevalent sustaining mechanisms for human AF. FIRM ablation at patient-specific sources acutely terminated or slowed AF, and improved outcome. These results offer a novel mechanistic framework and treatment paradigm for AF.

METHODS AND RESULTS Coronary-perfused human right atria from explanted diseased hearts (n = 8, 43-72 years old) were optically mapped simultaneously by three high-resolution CMOS cameras (two aligned Endo-Epi views (330 µm2 resolution) and one panoramic view). 3D gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GE-MRI, 80 µm3 resolution) revealed the atrial wall structure varied in thickness (1.0 ± 0.7-6.8 ± 2.4 mm), transmural fiber angle differences, and interstitial fibrosis causing transmural activation delay from 23 ± 11 to 43 ± 22 ms at increased pacing rates. Sustained AF ({\textgreater}90 min) was induced by burst pacing during pinacidil (30-100 µM) perfusion. Dual-sided sub-Endo-sub-Epi optical mapping revealed that AF was driven by spatially and temporally stable intramural re-entry with 107 ± 50 ms cycle length and transmural activation delay of 67 ± 31 ms. Intramural re-entrant drivers were captured primarily by sub-Endo mapping, while sub-Epi mapping visualized re-entry or 'breakthrough' patterns. Re-entrant drivers were anchored on 3D micro-anatomic tracks (15.4 ± 2.2 × 6.0 ± 2.3 mm2, 2.9 ± 0.9 mm depth) formed by atrial musculature characterized by increased transmural fiber angle differences and interstitial fibrosis. Targeted radiofrequency ablation of the tracks verified these re-entries as drivers of AF. CONCLUSIONS Integrated 3D structural-functional mapping of diseased human right atria ex vivo revealed that the complex atrial microstructure caused significant differences between Endo vs. Epi activation during pacing and sustained AF driven by intramural re-entry anchored to fibrosis-insulated atrial bundles.},

abstract = {Importance: Catheter ablation is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF), but its effects on long-term mortality and stroke risk are uncertain. Objective: To determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than conventional medical therapy for improving outcomes in AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial involving 126 centers in 10 countries. A total of 2204 symptomatic patients with AF aged 65 years and older or younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for stroke were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up through December 31, 2017. Interventions: The catheter ablation group (n = 1108) underwent pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablative procedures at the discretion of site investigators. The drug therapy group (n = 1096) received standard rhythm and/or rate control drugs guided by contemporaneous guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Among 13 prespecified secondary end points, 3 are included in this report: all-cause mortality; total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization; and AF recurrence. Results: Of the 2204 patients randomized (median age, 68 years; 37.2{\%} female; 42.9{\%} had paroxysmal AF and 57.1{\%} had persistent AF), 89.3{\%} completed the trial. Of the patients assigned to catheter ablation, 1006 (90.8{\%}) underwent the procedure. Of the patients assigned to drug therapy, 301 (27.5{\%}) ultimately received catheter ablation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, over a median follow-up of 48.5 months, the primary end point occurred in 8.0{\%} (n = 89) of patients in the ablation group vs 9.2{\%} (n = 101) of patients in the drug therapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95{\%} CI, 0.65-1.15]; P =.30). Among the secondary end points, outcomes in the ablation group vs the drug therapy group, respectively, were 5.2{\%} vs 6.1{\%} for all-cause mortality (HR, 0.85 [95{\%} CI, 0.60-1.21]; P =.38), 51.7{\%} vs 58.1{\%} for death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR, 0.83 [95{\%} CI, 0.74-0.93]; P =.001), and 49.9{\%} vs 69.5{\%} for AF recurrence (HR, 0.52 [95{\%} CI, 0.45-0.60]; P {\textless}.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower-than-expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.},

@article{Asad2019,
abstract = {Background: Despite the publication of several randomized clinical trials comparing catheter ablation (CA) with medical therapy (MT) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the superiority of one strategy over another is still questioned by many. In this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, we compared the efficacy and safety of CA with MT for AF. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other online sources for randomized controlled trials of AF patients that compared CA with MT. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular hospitalizations and recurrence of atrial arrhythmia. Subgroup analyses stratified by the presence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type of AF, age, and sex were performed. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95{\%} CIs were calculated using a random effects model, and Mantel-Haenszel method was used to pool RR. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials comprising 4464 patients (CA, n=2286; MT, n=2178) were included. CA resulted in a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.69; 95{\%} CI, 0.54-0.88; P=0.003) that was driven by patients with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (RR, 0.52; 95{\%} CI, 0.35-0.76; P=0.0009). CA resulted in significantly fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95{\%} CI, 0.39-0.81; P=0.002) and fewer recurrences of atrial arrhythmias (RR, 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.33-0.53; P{\textless}0.00001). Subgroup analyses suggested that younger patients (age, {\textless}65 years) and men derived more benefit from CA compared with MT. Conclusions: CA is associated with all-cause mortality benefit, that is driven by patients with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. CA reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations and recurrences of atrial arrhythmia for patients with AF. Younger patients and men appear to derive more benefit from CA.},
